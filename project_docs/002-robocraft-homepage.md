# RoboCraft Homepage Redesign

Redesign Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook home page with renaming \"RoboCraft\" Industrial-Kinetic Futurism aesthetic – dark industrial theme with animated robot joint motifs, blueprint-mode aesthetics, mechanical precision elements, steel and copper accents, glowing circuit pathways and kinetic motion interface highlights. Use frontend-design skill while implementing the homepage and image will be needed so create images through this skill also all images will be saved in @static\\ and @static/img\\.

Implementation should use frontend-design skill and be organized in @src\\ all like @src/components\\ @src/css\\ @src/pages\\ @src/pages/index.js is the homepage. Update homepage to include content from @COURSE_DETAILS.md and @Hackathon_I_Physical_AI_&_Humanoid_Robotics_Textbook.md in aesthetic manner.

Branch: robocraft-homepage

Redesign the RoboLearn landing page to establish a distinctive visual identity that embodies the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" theme. The design moves away from generic template aesthetics toward a cohesive "Industrial-Kinetic Futurism" visual language that communicates cutting-edge robotics education.

## Design

Theme:
Deep space dark (#08090d) – premium, serious, enterprise-grade foundation

Primary Color (Accent):
🔥 Industrial Orange (#f97316) – interactive elements, CTAs, highlights

Feels confident, decisive, and builder-focused (less “neon”, more “real-world power”)

Secondary Accent (Glow / Hover):
Warm amber (#fb923c) – hover states, soft glows, gradient edges

Success / Active Color:
Green (#22c55e) – active states, pulsing indicators, system-healthy signals

Keep this unchanged for clarity and UX consistency

Typography

Headlines: Space Grotesk – modern, engineered, confident

Code / Tech: JetBrains Mono – precise, industrial, hacker-clean

Motion & Interaction

Staggered fade-in animations for sections (confidence through pacing)

Pulsing orange indicators for active agents / live systems

Mouse-tracking gradient orb

Gradient: #f97316 → #fb923c → transparent

Low opacity, slow easing (premium, not playful)

Visual Motifs

Robot assembly SVG

Orange highlights on joints, sensors, and labels

Tech stack labels in muted gray → orange on hover

Grid pattern background

Subtle lines in dark gray

Orange intersection points or pulses

Floating labels / system tags

Dark cards with orange top-border or left accent line

Messaging & Tone

Solution-first, builder-focused copy

Personal journey framing: “Built from real problems, not theory.”

Confident, no-nonsense claim:

“Free forever. No lock-in. No gimmicks.”

- **Success Color**: Green (#22c55e) - active states, pulsing indicators
- **Typography**: Space Grotesk (headlines) + JetBrains Mono (code/tech) - industrial premium feel
- **Motion**: Staggered fade-in animations, pulsing dots, mouse-tracking gradient orb
- **Visual Motifs**: Robot assembly SVG with tech stack labels, grid pattern background, floating labels
- **Messaging**: Solution-focused copy, personal journey framing, confident "Free forever" statement

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - First-Time Visitor Landing (Priority: P1)

A prospective student lands on the RoboLearn home page for the first time and should immediately understand what the platform offers, feel the "Physical AI" theme, and be motivated to start learning.

**Why this priority**: First impressions determine conversion. The hero section is the most critical element for user retention.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the home page and verifying the hero section displays correctly with all animations, communicates the value proposition, and provides clear CTA.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the home page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see an animated hero with book cover, title, technology badges, and primary CTA within 2 seconds
2. **Given** a user views the hero section, **When** they read the content, **Then** they understand this is a Physical AI & Robotics learning platform
3. **Given** a user wants to start learning, **When** they click "Start Learning", **Then** they are navigated to the first lesson

---

### User Story 2 - Course Curriculum Discovery (Priority: P1)

A visitor scrolls to explore the curriculum structure and understands the learning path from ROS 2 fundamentals to autonomous humanoids.

**Why this priority**: Curriculum clarity is essential for enrollment decisions. Users need to see the full journey.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by scrolling to the modules section and verifying all 4 modules display with correct information and visual hierarchy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user scrolls past the hero, **When** they reach the modules section, **Then** they see all 4 modules displayed with titles, descriptions, topics, and week indicators
2. **Given** a user hovers on a module card, **When** the interaction occurs, **Then** the card provides visual feedback (glow, expansion, or highlight)
3. **Given** modules 3 and 4 are advanced, **When** displayed, **Then** they have visual distinction (badges: "AI-Powered", "Capstone")

---

### User Story 3 - Hardware Requirements Assessment (Priority: P2)

A prospective student evaluates hardware requirements to determine if they can participate in the course.

**Why this priority**: Hardware is a key enrollment barrier. Clear tier options reduce friction and anxiety.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing the hardware section and verifying all 3 tiers display with costs and recommendations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user reaches the hardware section, **When** they view the options, **Then** they see 3 clear tiers (Workstation, Cloud+Edge, Simulation Only) with cost estimates
2. **Given** a user is budget-conscious, **When** they see the "RECOMMENDED" badge on Cloud+Edge, **Then** they understand the balanced approach
3. **Given** a user has no hardware, **When** they see Simulation Only option, **Then** they understand they can still complete the course

---

### User Story 4 - Mobile Responsive Experience (Priority: P2)

A user accesses the home page from a mobile device and has a fully functional, visually appealing experience.

**Why this priority**: Significant traffic comes from mobile. Responsive design is essential for accessibility.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing the page on mobile viewport (375px width) and verifying layout, readability, and touch interactions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the page on mobile, **When** the page loads, **Then** all content is readable without horizontal scrolling
2. **Given** a user on mobile views the modules, **When** displayed, **Then** modules stack vertically and remain interactive
3. **Given** a user on mobile, **When** they tap CTAs, **Then** buttons have adequate touch targets (min 44px)

---

### User Story 5 - Dark/Light Mode Compatibility (Priority: P3)

The page respects system color preferences while maintaining the industrial aesthetic.

**Why this priority**: Accessibility and user preference. Lower priority as dark mode is the primary design.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by toggling system dark/light mode and verifying the page adapts appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has dark mode enabled, **When** they view the page, **Then** the full industrial-kinetic theme displays as designed
2. **Given** a user has light mode enabled, **When** they view the page, **Then** the page provides a light variant that maintains brand identity

### Edge Cases

- What happens when images fail to load? Fallback to styled placeholders with alt text
- How does the page handle slow connections? Progressive loading with skeleton states
- What happens when JavaScript is disabled? Core content remains accessible (graceful degradation)
- How does the page appear in reduced motion mode? Animations are disabled per user preference

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Font loading delays | Visual flash | Use font-display: swap, provide fallback fonts |
| Animation performance | Janky experience | Test on low-end devices, use GPU-accelerated properties |
| Dark theme accessibility | Poor readability | Verify contrast ratios, test with accessibility tools |
| Complex CSS maintenance | Technical debt | Use CSS variables consistently, document design tokens |
