adding this following in the specs



Replace robot and pulsive bubble and bubble machine with this:



Interactive 3D Robot Preview (Most Engaging)

Replace both with:



3D rotating humanoid robot model that users can drag to rotate

Shows the actual robot they'll build/simulate

Add subtle animation (breathing motion, eye glow, joint articulation)

Hover states: Different parts highlight with tooltips ("Servo motors", "AI vision system", "Balance sensors")



Why it works: Gives tactile preview of what they'll create, establishes credibility, tech-forward



and



do not show as platform to build robots



show it as book to learn to build these
