# Update spec with frontend design skill

## User Prompt
Update the 002 spec.md file to add frontend-design skill usage when started implementing (invoke it first time at task T001). This is mandatory. Claude have to use this skill for redesign in any condition

## Response
Updated the spec file to include FR-021 requirement that the frontend-design skill must be invoked at the first implementation task (T001) to ensure professional UI/UX design standards are applied from the beginning of development. Also added a Frontend Design System entity to the Key Entities section to emphasize the importance of the frontend-design skill.

## Outcome
Successfully updated specs/002-robocraft-ui/spec.md to mandate frontend-design skill usage at task T001 during implementation, ensuring professional UI/UX design standards are applied from the beginning of development.

## Evaluation
The specification now includes the required constraint that frontend-design skill must be used at the start of implementation (T001), meeting the user's requirements while maintaining the integrity of the existing specification.
