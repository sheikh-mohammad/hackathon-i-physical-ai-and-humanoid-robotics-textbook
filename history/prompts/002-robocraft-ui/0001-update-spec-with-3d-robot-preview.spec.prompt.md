## Prompt

--title "Update Spec with 3D Robot Preview" --stage spec --feature robocraft-homepage

## Response snapshot

Updated the RoboCraft homepage specification to replace the schematic-style robot with an interactive 3D robot preview that users can drag to rotate, showing the actual robot they'll build/simulate, with hover tooltips and subtle animations. Shifted the focus from platform to textbook approach with proper redirects to book content.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Updated spec to reflect 3D robot preview and textbook-focused approach
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated spec.md with new requirements for 3D robot preview, textbook focus, and proper redirects
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully transformed the homepage concept from a platform-building focus to a textbook learning focus with enhanced 3D visualization
