# Prompt History Record

## User Prompt
```
Update @specs/002-robocraft-ui/spec.md and make the useage of frontend-design skill as mandatory and should envoke it when start doing implementation (at task 001)
```

## Response Summary
Updated the specification file to make the frontend-design skill mandatory by:

1. Adding an "Implementation Requirements" section with:
   - IR-001: The frontend-design skill MUST be used to generate all UI components and styling
   - IR-002: All visual design elements MUST be created using the frontend-design skill during implementation
   - IR-003: The first implementation task (task 001) MUST invoke the frontend-design skill

2. Adding implementation notes in the Key Locations section emphasizing:
   - The frontend-design skill MUST be invoked at the start of implementation (task 001)
   - All UI components and styling should leverage the frontend-design skill for consistency

These changes ensure that the frontend-design skill will be explicitly required and used from the beginning of the implementation process.

## Outcome
The spec now clearly mandates the use of the frontend-design skill during implementation, particularly at the start (task 001), ensuring proper industrial aesthetic design is applied consistently.
