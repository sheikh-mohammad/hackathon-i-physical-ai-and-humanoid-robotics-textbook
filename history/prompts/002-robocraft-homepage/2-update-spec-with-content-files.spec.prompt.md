# Prompt History Record: Update Spec with Content Files

## Original Prompt
Update the 002-robocraft-homepage spec that these homepage should add this content @COURSE_DETAILS.md and @Hackathon_I_Physical_AI_&_Humanoid_Robotics_Textbook.md while creating homepage

## Response Summary
Updated the existing specification to include requirements for integrating content from COURSE_DETAILS.md and Hackathon_I_Physical_AI_&_Humanoid_Robotics_Textbook.md files into the RoboCraft holographic homepage. Added new user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria to ensure the course and hackathon information is incorporated aesthetically into the holographic design.

## Outcome
Successfully updated the specification with additional requirements for content integration while maintaining the holographic aesthetic approach.

## Evaluation
The specification now properly addresses the integration of external content files while preserving the original holographic design requirements.
