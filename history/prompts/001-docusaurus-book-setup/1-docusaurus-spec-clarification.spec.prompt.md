# Docusaurus Spec Clarification

## Prompt Text

```
/sp.clarify
```

## Response Text

Specification clarification completed for Docusaurus Book Setup feature. Five critical questions were asked and answered:

1. Docusaurus version: Latest stable with standard presets (classic theme)
2. Context7 integration: Claude Code will use Context7 MCP server during implementation time
3. Navigation: Auto-generate from folder structure
4. Branding: Custom textbook branding for Physical AI Humanoid and Robotics
5. Deployment: GitHub Pages using GitHub workflow deploy.yaml

The spec file was updated with these clarifications in a new "Clarifications" section, and the functional requirements and success criteria were updated to reflect the specific decisions made.

## Outcome

Successfully resolved critical ambiguities in the feature specification, enabling clear progression to the planning phase. The specification now contains concrete decisions on technology stack, integration approach, navigation strategy, branding, and deployment method.

## Evaluation

The clarification session achieved its goal of reducing ambiguity in the feature specification. All 5 questions addressed high-impact areas that would significantly influence the implementation approach. The specification is now sufficiently detailed to proceed to planning.
